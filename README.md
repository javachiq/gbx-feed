# Feed App

## Project Features
- Display posts
- Filter posts by User ID
- Sort post title by A-Z and Z-A
- Search text / keywords in post title and body

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Other libraries used are:
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/)
- For the design, [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/). I wanted it to look simple. Similar to most feed apps.
